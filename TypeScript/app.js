// primitive types (number , string , boolean)
//Arrays
//Tuples
//Enums
//Any,unknown,void,Null,undefiend,never
// there are two types of  data types in typescript primitive data type and reference data type
// primitive data type
// there are three way to create a variable var let const but don't use var
let age = 18;
let names = "Syed omer ali";
let isStudent = true;
// TypeScript ensures that age will only hold numbers, name will always be a string, and isStudent will only be true or false.
// arrays
// what is array ?
//An array is a collection of values of the same type.
let arrays = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let array2 = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"];
//The [ ] means this is an array. Every element in arrays must be a number, and every element in array2 must be a string.
//Tuples
//A tuple is like an array, but it has a fixed number of elements, and each element has a specific type.
let arr = ["syed", 18];
//Here, person[0] must be a string, and person[1] must be a number. You can't swap them!
//Enums
//Enums allow you to define a set of named constants.
