session storage : 

Imagine you have a secret diary 📖, but you can only read it while you're inside your room.

When you enter the room (open the website), you get a magic notebook (session storage) where you can write things down.
You can write (store) important things like your favorite color, your name, or a secret number.
As long as you stay inside the room (keep the browser open), you can check (read) or change (update) your notebook.
But the moment you leave the room (close the browser), the notebook disappears forever.
So, session storage is like a temporary memory that stores data only while you're visiting a website.

In Node.js + Express.js, we use session storage to remember things about the user while they are on the site, like:
✅ If they are logged in
✅ What their cart items are (if it's a shopping site)
✅ Their preferences (like dark mode)

Feature	           Session Storage	                     Local Storage	                          Cookies
Data Persistence	Until tab/browser is closed	         Stays until manually cleared	          Can have expiration time
Data Capacity	  ~5MB	                                 ~10MB	                                  ~4KB (smallest)
Access Scope	   Per tab/session	                      Across all tabs/windows	               Sent with every request to the server
Accessibility	   Only in JavaScript (client-side)	Only  in JavaScript (client-side)	           Accessible by both client and server
Security	       More secure (not sent to the server)	   More secure (not sent to the server)	    Less secure (sent with every request)
Use Case	       Temporary data (e.g., form inputs)	    Persistent settings, themes	            Authentication tokens, session tracking


When to Use What?
Session Storage → Temporary user data (e.g., form drafts, UI states).
Local Storage → Persistent settings (e.g., dark mode, saved preferences).
Cookies → Authentication (e.g., JWT tokens, session management).


cookies:

Imagine you go to your favorite ice cream shop. The shopkeeper gives you a "magic token" (cookie 🍪) that remembers your favorite ice cream flavor.

Every time you come back, you show the token.
The shopkeeper remembers you and gives you the same ice cream without asking again!
If you lose the token, the shopkeeper forgets your favorite ice cream.
In websites, cookies work the same way!

When you log in, the website gives you a cookie.
Every time you visit, your browser sends the cookie to the website.
The website remembers you!

Cookies store small data in the browser.
They help websites remember users (like login info or preferences).
We can set, get, and delete cookies using Express.js and TypeScript.

❌ What Cookies Can’t Do
They expire (some last for a few minutes, some for years).
They are small (only a few KB of data).
They are not very secure (hackers can steal them if not protected).
Cookies help websites remember you, but they don’t store too much data. If a website needs to save a lot of information, it uses local storage or databases instead.

localStorage:

Now, let's say you have a small notebook 📒 inside your backpack where you can write down important things, like:

Your name 🏷️
Your favorite game 🎮
Your best friend’s name 👦
This notebook inside your backpack is like local storage in your web browser! 🖥️

📝 How Local Storage Works
1️⃣ When a website needs to remember something, it writes it in the "notebook" (local storage).
2️⃣ Even if you close your browser or turn off your computer, the "notebook" still keeps the information.
3️⃣ The next time you open the website, it can read from the "notebook" and remember your details.

🎯 Example: A Game Saving Your High Score
You play an online car racing game 🏎️
You score 5000 points 🎯
The game saves your score in local storage
Even if you close your browser and come back tomorrow, your score is still there!

❌ What Local Storage Can’t Do
It only works on your browser, not on other computers.
It can’t store sensitive information (like passwords).
It doesn’t delete itself unless you clear it manually or write code to remove it.
